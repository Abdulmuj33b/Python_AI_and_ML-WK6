Q3: Discuss the societal impact of Human-AI collaboration in healthcare. How might it transform roles like radiologists or nurses?

Human-AI collaboration in healthcare is not about replacing medical professionals but augmenting them with intelligent tools that can process massive amounts of data rapidly and accurately.

Radiologists:
- AI tools like computer vision models can detect tumors or fractures in medical images faster than humans.
- Rather than replacing radiologists, AI enables them to focus on nuanced cases and second opinions, improving diagnostic efficiency.

Nurses:
- AI systems can assist in monitoring patient vitals in real-time, flagging anomalies early.
- Chatbots and AI-powered triage systems can answer routine patient queries, reducing nurse workload.

Societal Impact:
- Improved Access: AI can extend healthcare to underserved areas via remote diagnosis.
- Efficiency: Streamlined workflows reduce wait times and burnout.
- Ethical Concerns: Transparency, accountability, and bias must be managed carefully.

Human-AI collaboration is ushering in a new era of precision, proactive, and patient-centered care, while redefining roles rather than eliminating them.
